Hi, I’m @JoseAcry
I’m interested in education, policy and management, urban development, public policy, sustainable growth, community engagement, social welfare, inclusive education, public-private partnerships, data-driven decision-making, and contributing to the development of Indonesia's new era.
I’m currently learning and acquiring knowledge about monitoring, evaluation, research, and learning activities that facilitate the creation of integrated data, reflecting significant trends in the context of Global Education Change in the millennium era.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to policy development, sustainable urban growth, inclusive education, and data-driven decision-making. My aim is to work alongside like-minded individuals dedicated to enhancing educational quality, accessibility, and innovation. By partnering with experts in these fields, I hope to contribute to transformative initiatives that have a lasting impact on communities and societies.
You can reach me through email at joseacry@outlook.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at LinkedIn Profile. Feel free to send me a message or connect to discuss potential collaborations, share insights, or engage in meaningful conversations related to education, policy, and positive societal change. I look forward to connecting with you!
